Its rich and engaging story is intertwined with the development of human cognition and the incessant search for playful ways to improve the mind. The origins of the game date back to the beginning of the 20th century, with several versions appearing in Europe and the United States. One of the first documented references dates back to 1908, with the game Memory by the English company Selchow & Righter. Another popular version, Parcheesi, was introduced by Parker Brothers in 1918. Over time, the Memory Game gained global popularity, taking on different forms and themes. The cards, initially illustrated with simple figures, evolved into vibrant and creative designs, exploring everything from animals and objects to cartoon characters and historical themes. The importance of the Memory Game lies in its various benefits for cognitive development, especially for children. The game stimulates short-term memory, attention, concentration and information processing capacity. Furthermore, it promotes creativity, problem solving and strategic decision making. To play, simply shuffle the cards and place them face down on a flat surface. Each player, in turn, reveals two cards in search of pairs with identical images. Upon finding a pair, the player removes it from the table and gets the chance to play again. The objective is to accumulate the largest number of pairs at the end of the game. The Memory Game stands out for its simplicity and versatility, and can be adapted to different age groups and needs. For young children, for example, it is possible to use a smaller number of cards and simpler themes. For more experienced players, cards with more complex images and additional rules can be introduced.","recursosVerBen":"See benefits"}
